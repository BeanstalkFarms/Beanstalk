/**
 * MANUAL VOLUME CALCULATION IS DEPRECATED. See ../Volume:calcLiquidityVolume
 *
 * Calculates the amount of volume resulting from a liquidity add operation.
 * The methodology is as follows:
 *
 * When adding liquidity in unbalanced proportions, we treat it as if some of one asset must first be bought,
 * and then the rest is added in a balanced proportion.
 *
 * We know the constant product before adding liquidity, and after adding liquidity. The
 * newer constant product can be scaled down until it reaches the older constant product.
 * From there, it becomes clear how much of an asset must have been purchased as a result.
 *
 * Example: initial 1500 BEAN and 1 ETH. If 1500 BEAN liquidity is added, in terms of buy pressure, this is equivalent
 * to buying 0.29289 ETH for 621 BEAN and then adding in equal proportions.
 * After that purchase there would be 2121 BEAN and 0.70711 ETH, which can be scaled up to (3000, 1) in equal proportion.
 * The below implementation solves this scenario backwards.
 *
 * @param currentReserves - the current reserves, after the liquidity event
 * @param addedReserves - the net change in reserves after the liquidity event
 * @returns a list of tokens and the amount bought of each. the purchased token is positive, the sold token negative.
