            The Field is Beanstalk&#39;s credit facility. Beanstalk relies on a
            decentralized set of creditors to maintain Bean price stability.
            Farmers who Sow Beans (lend Beans to Beanstalk) are known as Sowers.
            Beans are Sown in exchange for Pods, the Beanstalk-native debt
            asset. Loans to Beanstalk are issued with a fixed interest rate,
            known as Temperature, and an unknown maturity date.

              <Typography>
                The number of Pods received from 1 Sown Bean is determined by
                the Temperature at the time of Sowing. Newly issued Pods
                accumulate in the back of the Pod Line. The front of the Pod
                Line receives 1/3 of new Bean mints when there are  outstanding 
                Sprouts (Sprouts are issued by the Barn). If
                there are no outstanding Sprouts, the front of the Pod Line
                receives 1/2 of new Bean mints.
              </Typography>
              <Typography>
                Pods become Harvestable (redeemable) into Beans on a FIFO basis. Pods
                are tradeable on the Market.
