# This file exists solely for the purpose of facilitating all codegen in a shared location such that all ABIs
# or templates are expanded independently of being used in all chains. Most of the information here is irrelevant,
# the only important part is in the `abis` and `templates` sections.
#  - For abis, its only the list of abis that is relevant. The name of the dataSource is also visible.
#  - For templates, it is only the name of the template that is relevant.
