/*
 * As a part of Bip-0 OldAppStorage was migrated to AppStorage. Several state variables were remapped, removed or shuffled.
 *
 * 2 memory slots (stalkBase and increaseBase) were removed from Rain.
 * 1 memory slot was added to Silo (roots). reentrantStatus (was depreciated1) was added after Silo
 * Thus, 2 memory slots were removed and 2 were added, so the storage mapping is contained.
 * The in-between memory slots in Silo were migrated in InitBip0
 *
 * IncreaseSilo changed from 5 slots to 2 slots.
 * V1IncreaseSilo was added after SeasonOfPlenty with 3 slots.
 * Thus, IncreaseSilo and SeasonOfPlenty map to IncreaseSilo, SeasonOfPlenty and V1IncreaseSilo accounting for 8 total slots.
 * Required migrations (such as SeasonOfPlenty shifting) were accounted for in InitBip0
 * Thus, no memory was shifted unintentionally as 5 slots map to 5 slots
 *
 * seasons, sops, and rbs were removed. Mappings take up 1 slot, so 3 slots were removed.
 * They were replaced with unclaimedRoots, v2SIBeans, sops
 * seasons was changed to unclaimedRoots (1 slot -> 1 slot)
 * sops was changed to v2SIBeans (1 slot -> 1 slot)
 * rbs was changed to sops (1 slot -> 1 slot, Note: This sops variable in AppStorage is completely different than sops variable in AppStorageOld).
 * No memory was shifted unintentionally as 3 slots map to 3 slots
 *
 * a remains at the same place in memory, so no memory should have been changed.
 * The Account struct changed slightly, but no memory slots were shifted.
 *
 * bip0Stalk, hotFix3Stalk, fundraiser, fundraiserIndex were added to the end of the state.
 * Because these variables were appended to the end of the state, no variables were overwritten by doing so.
