/**
 * @author Brean
 * @title L2MigrationFacet
 * @notice Allows 1) farmers with external bean balances and 2) contracts with native bean assets to migrate onto L2.
 * @dev When migrating to an L2, given a majority of bean assets reside in the diamond contract,
 * Beanstalk is able to send these assets to an L2. Beanstalk does not have control of Bean or Wells
 * where tokens are paired with Beans. Given beanstalk cannot receive these assets, as well as a potenital
 * double-spend if Beanstalk were to mint external beans to these users (where a user is able to sell their
 * L1 Beans for value), Beanstalk allows Farmers who hold Beans to 1) Burn their Beans on L1 and 2) Issue the
 * same amount on L2.
 *
 * Beanstalk also allows contracts that own Beanstalk assets to approve an address on L2 to recieve their assets.
 * Beanstalk cannot mint Beanstalk assets to an contract on L2, as it cannot assume that the owner of the contract
 * has access to the same address on L2.
