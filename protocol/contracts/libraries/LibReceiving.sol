 * @notice Holds the logic responsible for receiving Bean shipments after mints. These
 *  functions must be delegatecalled from inside of the Beanstalk Diamond. If new receiving components
 *  are needed, this library and its calling Facet will need to be updated.
 * @dev An alternative design could remove the need for the generalized receive() entry function
 *  and instead require the shipping route to define the selector of its own corresponding receive
 *  function. However, both designs will require a Facet cut if a new receive function is needed,
 *  so this design was chosen for additional clarity.
 * @dev Functions are internal, but only pulled into LibShipping. Reduces the size of facet.
