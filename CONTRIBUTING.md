# Contributing

Beanstalk strives to become become a fully decentralized protocol. This involves making Beanstalk's codebase an open-sourced project that anyone should feel free to contribute to.

Some areas that users can contribute to:

- Submitting Beanstalk Improvement Proposals (BIPs). BIPs can alter, add to or remove Beanstalk's existing functionality
- Reporting issues.
- Fixing and responding to any reported issues on the repository
- Improving the documentation.
- Getting involved Beanstalk's development process in the Beanstalk Discord

### Workflow

Contributions to Beanstalk's codebase should be made through pull requests into the master branch.

### BIPs

- If the pull request alters Beanstalk's Solidity source code, it should be accompanied with an on-chain BIP and the alternations must match the source code of the proposed BIP changes.
- The pull request should also include an updated version of the Whitepaper in accordance to the BIP

### Documentation, Tooling, etc...

- If the pull request updates supplementary files such as documentation and tooling in the Beanstalk repository, the pull request will be reviewed by the product managers and be merged in upon approval.
