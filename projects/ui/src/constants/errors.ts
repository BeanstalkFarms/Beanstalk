  // This Error indicates that the attempted operation is not supported.
  //
  // This could range from a specifc JSON-RPC end-point not supporting

  // For example, a Wallet with no connected Provider is unable
  // to send a transaction.

  // This Error indicates that the timeout duration has expired and

  //
  // The side-effect of the operation may still occur, as this
