/**
 * @title LibSilo
 * @author Publius
 * @notice Contains functions for minting, burning, and transferring of
 * Stalk and Roots within the Silo.
 *
 * @dev Here, we refer to "minting" as the combination of
 * increasing the total balance of Stalk/Roots, as well as allocating
 * them to a particular account. However, in other places throughout Beanstalk
 * (like during the Sunrise), Beanstalk's total balance of Stalk increases
 * without allocating to a particular account. One example is {Sun-rewardToSilo}
 * which increases `s.silo.stalk` but does not allocate it to any account. The
 * allocation occurs during `{SiloFacet-plant}`. Does this change how we should
 * call "minting"?
 *
 * In the ERC20 context, "minting" increases the supply of a token and allocates
 * the new tokens to an account in one action. I've adjusted the comments below
 * to use "mint" in the same sense.
