 * @param paused True if Beanstalk is Paused.
 * @param pausedAt The timestamp at which Beanstalk was last paused.

 * @param r Storage.Rain
 * @param s Storage.Silo
 * @param reentrantStatus An intra-transaction state variable to protect against reentrance.
 * @param w Storage.Weather
 * @param earnedBeans The number of Beans distributed to the Silo that have not yet been Deposited as a result of the Earn function being called.
 * @param deprecated DEPRECATED - 14 slots that used to store state variables which have been deprecated through various updates. Storage slots can be left alone or reused.
 * @param a mapping (address => Account.State)
 * @param deprecated_bip0Start DEPRECATED - bip0Start was used to aid in a migration that occured alongside BIP-0.
 * @param deprecated_hotFix3Start DEPRECATED - hotFix3Start was used to aid in a migration that occured alongside HOTFIX-3.
 * @param fundraisers A mapping from Fundraiser ID to Storage.Fundraiser.
 * @param fundraiserIndex The number of Fundraisers that have occured.
 * @param deprecated_isBudget DEPRECATED - Budget Facet was removed in BIP-14. 
 * @param podListings A mapping from Plot Index to the hash of the Pod Listing.
 * @param podOrders A mapping from the hash of a Pod Order to the amount of Pods that the Pod Order is still willing to buy.
 * @param siloBalances A mapping from Token address to Silo Balance storage (amount deposited and withdrawn).
 * @param ss A mapping from Token address to Silo Settings for each Whitelisted Token. If a non-zero storage exists, a Token is whitelisted.
 * @param deprecated2 DEPRECATED - 2 slots that used to store state variables which have been deprecated through various updates. Storage slots can be left alone or reused.
 * @param deprecated_newEarnedStalk the amount of earned stalk issued this season. Since 1 stalk = 1 bean, it represents the earned beans as well.
 * @param sops A mapping from Season to Plenty Per Root (PPR) in that Season. Plenty Per Root is 0 if a Season of Plenty did not occur.
 * @param internalTokenBalance A mapping from Farmer address to Token address to Internal Balance. It stores the amount of the Token that the Farmer has stored as an Internal Balance in Beanstalk.
 * @param unripeClaimed True if a Farmer has Claimed an Unripe Token. A mapping from Farmer to Unripe Token to its Claim status.
 * @param u Unripe Settings for a given Token address. The existence of a non-zero Unripe Settings implies that the token is an Unripe Token. The mapping is from Token address to Unripe Settings.
 * @param fertilizer A mapping from Fertilizer Id to the supply of Fertilizer for each Id.
 * @param nextFid A linked list of Fertilizer Ids ordered by Id number. Fertilizer Id is the Beans Per Fertilzer level at which the Fertilizer no longer receives Beans. Sort in order by which Fertilizer Id expires next.
 * @param activeFertilizer The number of active Fertilizer.
 * @param fertilizedIndex The total number of Fertilizer Beans.
 * @param unfertilizedIndex The total number of Unfertilized Beans ever.
 * @param fFirst The lowest active Fertilizer Id (start of linked list that is stored by nextFid). 
 * @param fLast The highest active Fertilizer Id (end of linked list that is stored by nextFid). 
 * @param bpf The cumulative Beans Per Fertilizer (bfp) minted over all Season.
 * @param deprecated_vestingPeriodRoots deprecated - removed in BIP-39 in favor of germination.
 * @param recapitalized The number of USDC that has been recapitalized in the Barn Raise.
 * @param isFarm Stores whether the function is wrapped in the `farm` function (1 if not, 2 if it is).
 * @param ownerCandidate Stores a candidate address to transfer ownership to. The owner must claim the ownership transfer.
 * @param wellOracleSnapshots A mapping from Well Oracle address to the Well Oracle Snapshot.
 * @param deprecated_beanEthPrice DEPRECATED - The price of bean:eth, originally used to calculate the incentive reward. Deprecated in favor of calculating using twaReserves.
 * @param twaReserves A mapping from well to its twaReserves. Stores twaReserves during the sunrise function. Returns 1 otherwise for each asset. Currently supports 2 token wells.
 * @param migratedBdvs Stores the total migrated BDV since the implementation of the migrated BDV counter. See {LibLegacyTokenSilo.incrementMigratedBdv} for more info.
 * @param usdEthPrice  Stores the usdEthPrice during the sunrise() function. Returns 1 otherwise.
 * @param seedGauge Stores the seedGauge.
 * @param casesV2 Stores the 144 Weather and seedGauge cases.
 * @param oddGerminating Stores germinating data during odd seasons.
 * @param evenGerminating Stores germinating data during even seasons.
 * @param whitelistedStatues Stores a list of Whitelist Statues for all tokens that have been Whitelisted and have not had their Whitelist Status manually removed.
 * @param sopWell Stores the well that will be used upon a SOP. Unintialized until a SOP occurs, and is kept constant afterwards.
